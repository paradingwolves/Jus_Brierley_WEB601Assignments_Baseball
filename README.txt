    - added 3 contentItems to my private array using the add() method i created
    - cannot get items to display using my displayAtIndex() method, so for the time being I am using the 
    *ngFor attribute to display all array items
    - although the displayAtIndex() method fails to give me HTML output, it will disply an error message
    when an invalid index is given (this will be a javascript alert)

    - time to fix my display error (wish me luck lol)
    - moved my displayAtIndex method call from the constructor to the ngOnInit method and now the method
    displays HTML content
