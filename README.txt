    - added 3 contentItems to my private array using the add() method i created
    - cannot get items to display using my displayAtIndex() method, so for the time being I am using the 
    *ngFor attribute to display all array items
    - although the displayAtIndex() method fails to give me HTML output, it will disply an error message
    when an invalid index is given (this will be a javascript alert)
